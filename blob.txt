[removed]The US 7 day average rose the last 3 days as wellV shaped recovery for covid cases [https://i.imgur.com/QuSfANN.png](https://i.imgur.com/QuSfANN.png)**Pent up demand for new infections**  https://imgur.com/iIvLaPgIt's coming for us in the United States as well. All this early opening, lack of face masks, and general ignoring of the fact that covid19 still exists is going to bite us in the ass!Ooohf. With the current protests, early opening of red states, and Trump's stupidity, this is bound to also happen in the US. This is why i'm sticking cash gang.Pretty irrelevant now. The shutdowns were politicians panicing, that won't happen again. The virus is not *that* bad to justify draconian containment.Asking Huawei to handle our 5g infrastructure would be like Iran or China trusting Lockheed Martin to handle their air defense radar system.You mean to tell me we can't trust the Chinese Communist Party with our telecommunications?!?**This article by Reuters is incredibly damning to Huawei which has long had accusations of espionage and IP theft by the US and countless other international corporations as a proxy of the  Chinese Communist Party:**https://youtu.be/GiG9fGfgydU[The American tech giant HP was caught doing the same thing.](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29iht-hp.4.18984271.html) This isn't a US vs China thing. Companies like to make money and don't care about skirting laws so long as its profitable.I read this as “hawaii hid”Highly questionable about Huawei using 5g to monitor US behavior. Would love to see some tech expert to explain how they gonna manage to do that under FBI and all the service suppliers around US. Personally feel like US targeting huaiwei as a way to preserve US tech company and just come up with a theory that China Huawei has safety issue.The US has no right to put sanctions on Iran or HuaweiThe government has no morale authority to dictate the use of private property. Meng did nothing wrong.The US pretty much lost all credibility with me on embargo’s for security when they slapped egregious duties on  steel imports from western allies.  Woof woof.Good job by Huawei for not bending the knee to USNobody gives a shit except Trump (for some reason).Can you blame them? At least the hotel, airline, and restaurant industries are able to bill this as a temporary and relatively one-dimensional crisis. Car dealerships are dealing with the following:* Demand for new cars has [plummeted](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/coronavirus-pandemic-tanks-us-auto-sales-in-april.html) due to COVID-19.* Prices for used cars are [plummeting](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/25/the-auto-industrys-ticking-timebomb-how-plunging-u.aspx) as well, further exacerbating the issue. * The supply-side automobile industry is struggling as well due to a huge dependence on [long supply chains](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/business/ford-gm-auto-suppliers-covid-19/index.html) and vertical integration. * The future of the automobile industry at large was already facing challenges due to the general reticence [Millennials](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/08/04/the-reasons-why-millennials-arent-as-car-crazed-as-baby-boomers-and-how-self-driving-cars-fit-in/#4f388f2863fc) have with respect to purchasing new cars. * All of these factors together are hitting the already-weak and antiquated model of selling new cars via dealerships. The general consensus is that people are going to increasingly purchase their cars [online](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/the-coronavirus-pandemic-has-upended-auto-sales-and-buying-a-car-will-never-be-the-same.html). This means centralization, where large big-box online distributors like [cars.com](https://cars.com) will simply outcompete independent car delearships that are now years behind in terms of their value proposition. * Even ignoring all of this, the new car industry is extremely vulnerable to economic downturns. Between credit freezes, and the general demand elasticity of the new car market, folks simply buy [far fewer cars during recession time](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/was-the-government-bailout-of-car-financers-necessary). Should the recovery stall, the automobile industry will have to contend with the by-itself disastrous challenge of fighting through the recession-driven demand slump. And this time, they won't be able to sell surplus cars to rental agencies nearly so easily. In short, with the exception of luxury / botique niches, the car dealership industry is in for [troubling times](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/25/the-auto-industrys-ticking-timebomb-how-plunging-u.aspx).Are they talking about loans to the ultimate purchaser of the vehicle, or floor-plan financing so that they dealership has cars on the lot ?The CUs are paying abysmal deposit interest rates, so vehicle loans there should be reasonable at the moment.This has greater implications. If smaller independent businesses pose a higher risk, only large companies will have access to the capital to ride this out. They will also be in a position to purchase/expand coverage as competition dies out. The long game wins as inevitably sales will return. Consolidation of markets is not good for the consumer.^(Analogy:) The real effect of larger companies buying houses when they were being defaulted on has raised the bar for many people trying to buy a house. Making it more likely that they will be forced to continue renting. What if all of a sudden buying a car was a luxury for wealthy and super credited persons while the rest of us could only lease or buy used due to the 'risk' and legality associated with a purchase. Repossessing a rental or leased vehicle is easier than a purchased one, which is very similar to evictions in housing (rental eviction compared to home owner evictions). *We do live in a time where we restrict bandwidth to create pricing tiers. Not that this kind of practice is in any way novel.*^(OP/ED:) Millennials eschew many things due to having less money, its not  a choice. Its not abstract. They have less to work with by the numbers. Its a bit ridiculous to imply moodiness, fashion or irresponsibility in the light of what they have to spend, which of course has to take into account debt.As a former executive of corporate banking, independent dealerships are high risk in normal times.  The floor audits are always messy.  I'm assuming they have above average exposure to this industry thus reducing risk...or they are just reducing risk.  Side note:  One of the best jobs I had during my bank intern executive training program back in my college days was floor plan auditor.  Drive to dealerships and make sure the money is used for cars not other stuff.  God it was fun....also dealt with so much fraud.I don't see this as a bad thing. They're getting ahead of a potential issue and ensuring their loans will be repaid based on a risk forecast.If someone wants to get an auto loan there are plenty of other lenders who will fund the loan and accept that risk based on their own level of risk aversion.Can anyone expand on the somewhat cryptic reference to the Fed at the end of the article?> Scandal-plagued Wells Fargo has an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet, which has limited its ability to make loans to help customers through the crisis.>> The U.S. Federal Reserve has “temporarily and narrowly” modified the growth restriction on the lender’s balance sheet.It's the financing on these deals that have gotten better. If you have pretty good credit, you can get 0% apr for 72 to 84 months. 6 to 7 years of payments all going to paying down principal.Why do they exist as an industry, outside of public ignorance of motor vehicles?Gas vehicles are going to become ancient relics08 all over againStop buying cars.What about made up car dealerships?Don’t fossil fuel companies get a lot of subsidy assistance that’s never talked about?Daily reminder that comparing the cost of installing solar *capacity* with coal is meaningless because of intermittence. You have to compare the cost of storage + PV with coal.It already does in many areasMore solar will just exacerbate the duck curve which will stall adoption. The electrical grid needs to invest in way more storage to use solarIn white collar jobs they're about halfway through. Most companies don't move fast enough to do it yetMy guess is that companies have been hanging on to hope and hope will die over the next few months.  I’d say they’re just getting started.the second wave will impact different industries than the first wave?Maybe because the rich are cash rich with the bailout money.It’s a shame that all this money is sitting in bank account instead of helping the economy. This is why you don’t give money at the top of pyramid. Everything the rich own is to generate through the economy.Next crash will be overnight, with massive insider trading.The neighborhoods, and jobs of the middle-class, the engine of the economy and the stock market, have not been damaged by the riots.The riots are very geographically limited. They are not something new. They are not even that unexpected. Most middle-class people live in the suburbs precisely because they want peace, quiet, and law-and-order.It would be like asking why the stock market isn't dropping when thousands of people get murdered by gun violence every year. Well, because it's not Google or Boeing engineers getting killed. It doesn't really affect the economy.There's nothing else to invest in. Either keep your money in cash and watch it inflate away, or buy stocks. Bonds pay too little.What should I invest in?>**A big factor keeping the markets going is the trillions in stimulus from the Fed, other central banks and governments around the world.**So they get all kinds of free cash and then speculate how much *more* money they will make once people are off UI and forced to face a labor market with no actual work to apply for? Makes sense.Unlimited QE and repo since before recession indicators, nuff said.The fact that this unrest and back and forth in society exists makes me confident as an investor that the US will endure for a long time and overcome this problem like they have overcome others.I hear fed stimulus is a major reason for this rallying market despite many pessimistic indicators. I don't know to what extent that is true, but I can't imagine that will come without drawbacks in the futureThat's  what happens when the corporations get bailed outA stock is not love.It looks like this post may have political content.

Muni markets are in horrible shape.I never understood how mass protection from evictions made sense.Relief should be targeted. Instead, we have people and companies with the means to cover rent opting not to because they don’t have to. This is not a desirable outcome.July 2020, if you think the riots are bad now, wait until unemployment benefits run out!Good, I would like to buy some cheap foreclosures and rent them back out at more than they were paying in mortgageAnd the dollar hasn’t even crashed yet...Refi.sIt says applications.  Which is likely people getting funding together.    I know some friends that were out of the housing market because it was too hot and they are now talking to banks to get pre-financing together.  The process still requires time and lots of documents.  People are getting their "ducks in a row" for a potential drop.A house across the street from me went on the market.  Just under $400k which is way above median in my area.  It's a nice new sub division.  I thought it would be a good test on consumer market demand.  The house sold in a week.  One other new house just sold.  All homes are a minimum of $300k so this is not usually a high demand market.  Real estate is very regional, so one area can be hot while another cold.  Very interesting to see how areas differ.Doesn't surprise me. Not a very rational market, and people think there are "deals" now even though HPI hasn't movedCorona is so badLowering taxes and increasing spending? Makes sense, inflation totally has never burned Germany in the past.Lowering your sales tax to 300% mine. Nice. Regressive taxes ftw.Meh. I wouldnt say "back under the spotlight". Compared to 2008 they obviously did a better job, the rising corporate debt numbers were perfectly reflectled in companies rating (most of it is concentrated in junk bonds). It's just that economies literally shutting down has a tremendous effect even on healthy companies, hence massive downgrades in April. You can't just turn off an economy and expect to turn it back on, companies are obviously going to suffer cash on hands or not. (and having to much cash is actually a problem for a company but that's another issue.)The problem would have been if in April they didn't downgraded and let companies who might not be investment grade anymore, benefit from the low interest rates in bonds due to QE.There is absolutely NO RISK of a credit downgrade in US Treasuries!https://www.theglobalist.com/a-brief-history-of-u-s-defaults/Read that again!

The SEC ignored Harry Markoloplous, an analyst, when he GAVE them evidence THREE TIMES of the Madoff Ponzi scheme 8 YEARS before they acted. Bernie Madoff, who was once the chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange, conned investors out of approximately $65 billion, making it the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Markopoloshttps://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1242080122. Allen Stanford’s Ponzi scheme, conducted through his Stanford International Bank, scammed investors out of $7 billion. He was convicted in 2012.

Countries in South America that still trade with China will buy at the reduced prices, mark it up to the original prices, and ship it off to China.The only losers will be the American farmers, who will be made whole by the government, taking in the handouts while decrying socialism.They own Smithfield...one of the largest commercial pork suppliers in the world. Based in NC, they don’t have to buy American pork. They own American pork.What happens if China misses their Phase 1 requirements?Does the deal automatically fall apart or does it have penalties built in?One step closer to aggression.They want their rivals hurt in every way possible. Now that America’s on fire even the tinniest drop of gasoline could cause severe (economic) damage.“Asks”💛💚💙❤️ Don’t worry the genius Central Bank economists will just print away the demand gap and we’ll be back to 5% GDP growth again.> state firms So all Chinese firms then.The propaganda is strong with this one.Screw China!I wonder if they’re going to use this to call out The US on the handling of the protests. It doesn’t have any moral weight since they’re guilty of far worse, but they have a loud voice and can use it as leverage in international organizations IF the US ends up complying with deescalation demands in exchange for economic stabilization. We’re in a far weaker state than the numbers predicted and it’s starting to show. An added bonus is that it has the potential to sway Americans’ opinion of the state.May be too tinfoil hat.Good, the US is about to get it’s just comeuppance. Greatest country in the world my ass.I wonder if China couldn't try to buy up all the food in the US at the moment to try and cause mass starvation. Specifically, since the supply chain is so throttled, they might be able to make a significant impact if they bought all the pork, say.I imagine local producers wouldn't be as effected, however.How dare you make me click a link and read something.Unrelated- another opinion piece about how we should “rebuild”.  Talks about being green and fair.Succinct and relevant.Refreshing among all the other noise these days.>we have seen a massive injection of fiscal stimulus to help countries deal with this crisisE.g. Countries are doubling down on the businesses that got us into this mess in the first place.&#x200B;>Governments can put in place public investmentsLol the pleb-lic? Give one side uniforms and let them shoot each other in the streets. Yo J. Pow, shell out more bailouts and tell CNBC to keep posting riot videos.Fiscal stimulus would be more effective. Negative interest rates haven’t boosted aggregate demand in japan or elsewhere where they’ve been tried.The ECB tried it, not for the same reasons (they were trying to push inflation) but we saw the effects. Eroding profits for the banks which increases risk taking and instability, bond market not profitable meaning redirection toward pretty risky assets and the list goes on... It works but do we want that?It's too dangerous, and the FED has a history of not knowing when to hit the brakes.I can’t believe we’re still talking about a V recovery like its still even possible.This is all nonsense. The number one thing needed for a "V" recovery is to solve the Covid-19 problem (treatments, vaccines...). Fiscal and monetary responses are secondary.If the protests don’t lead to a surge in new cases, doesnt the argument for lockdown die?I actually thought a V shaped recovery was impossible but now there’s a path to itIf recovery happens too fast , you might start runaway inflation .How are negative interests rates going to increase consumer demand? No one will be taking on leverage in the current scenario.For example, I am not sure if I'll have a job next year. I was considering buying a car pre-CoViD, but that's certainly not happening unless I get a -10% loan.Negative interest rates will cause the banks to collapse the way they did in the Great Depression. FDIC will be broke and American Civil War 2.0 will become inevitable. By that time, the value of your assets will be the least of your worries.GG free marketsRemind me to never listen to anything Zandi says, ever.This seems stupid. Thousands of small businesses will not be opening back up.Let's see commercial mortgage delinquencies for May.2.7 million job losses doesn't sound like no recession lolThose AAA rubber stampings can continue.Dead cat bounce?With all the money sloshing around and a false bottom created by the fed, how many times could it bounce if so?  Indefinitely? 🤷🏽‍♂️Um, yeeeeeeah. Okay.COVID19 *is* over. If you can riot, you can go to a restaurant.
